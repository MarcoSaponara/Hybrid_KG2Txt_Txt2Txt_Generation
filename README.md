# Hybrid Neural Knowledge Graph-to-Text and Text-to-Text Generation
Software implementation of my Master's Thesis "Hybrid Neural Knowledge Graph-to-Text and Text-to-Text Generation"

We aim at generating a descriptive text starting from an input Knowledge Graph (KG) which is also enriched with relevant information extracted from a textual context associated with the KG.

The system is based on three phases:
1) Pure KG2Text generation;
2) Content selection from the context;
3) Combination of the intermediate outputs from the previous steps.
